			<em>On BLAS Level-3 Implementations of Common Solvers for
                        (Quasi-) Triangular Generalized Lyapunov Equations</em><br>
SLICOT Working Note 2014-1: September 2014.</a>
			<dd><br>
			<dd> The solutions of Lyapunov and generalized Lyapunov equations are a key player in many applications in 
	                systems and control theory. Their stable numerical computation, when the full solution is sought, is 
        	        considered solved since the seminal work of Bartels and Stewart. A number of variants of their algorithm
                	have been proposed, but none of them goes beyond BLAS level-2 style implementation. On modern 
	                computers, however, the formulation of BLAS level-3 type implementations is crucial to enable optimal 
        	        usage of cache hierarchies and modern block scheduling methods based on directed acyclic graphs describing 
                	the interdependence of single block computations. Our contribution closes this gap by a transformation 
                	of the aforementioned level-2 variants to level-3 versions and a comparison on a standard multicore machine.

			<em>How a Numerical Rank Revealing Instability Affects Computer Aided Control System Design</em><br>
SLICOT Working Note 2010-1: January 2010.</a>
			<dd><br>
			<dd> Since numerical libraries are used in engineering design in a variety of industrial applications, it is
			important that their numerical reliability is the top priority of both the developers of numerical algorithms
			and users from industry. Following that principle, we have examined a state of the art control library
			(case study: SLICOT) with respect to use of rank revealing subroutines in computing various canonical
			decompositions of linear time invariant systems. This issue seems to be critical, with potential for causing
			numerical catastrophes, because the deployed rank revealing code is prone to severe instabilities, causing
			completely wrongly computed parameters of systems under analysis. We analyze the SLICOT library
			in detail and propose modifications of critical parts of the code, based on our recent work published
			in the ACM Trans. Math. Softw. 35, 2008, where we analyze and solve the problem. The proposed
			modifications increase numerical reliability of all of the sixty affected subroutines. We recommend that
			the developers of other control theory numerical libraries examine their codes with respect to the issue
			discussed in this paper.

			<em>The SLICOT Toolboxes - a Survey</em><br>
SLICOT Working Note 2009-1: August 2009.</a>
			<dd><br>
			<dd> SLICOT is a comprehensive numerical software package for control 
                systems analysis and design.  While based on highly performant 
                Fortran routines, MATLAB and Scilab interfaces provide convenient 
                access for users. In this survey, we summarize the functionality 
                contained in the three SLICOT toolboxes for (i) basic tasks in 
                systems and control, (ii) system identification, and (iii) 
                model reduction.  Several examples illustrate the use of these 
                toolboxes for addressing frequent computational tasks.

			<em>Evaluation of the Linear Matrix Equation Solvers in SLICOT</em><br>
SLICOT Working Note 2004-1: September 2004.</a>
			<dd><br>
			<dd> We discuss solvers for Sylvester, Lyapunov, and Stein equations
                that are available in  the SLICOT Library.  These solvers offer improved

                The performance of the SLICOT solvers is compared with the 
                corresponding  MATLAB solvers. This note can also serve as a

  <dd>A set of Fortran 77 subroutines aimed to perform mu-synthesis procedure 
    via DK iterations or H-inf design alone is presented. The software is intended

    <em>New Numerical Software for Model and Controller Reduction</em><br>
    SLICOT Working Note 2002-5: June 2002.</a> 
  <dd><br>
  <dd>We describe the recently developed model and controller reduction software 
    for SLICOT within Task II.B of the NICONET Project. A powerful collection 
    of user callable Fortran 77 routines has been implemented based on the latest 
    algorithmic developments which cover the relative error model reduction using 
    the balanced stochastic truncation approach, model reduction using frequency-weighted 
    balancing and frequency-weighted Hankel-norm approximation methods, as well 
    as special controller reduction methods using the frequency-weighted balancing 
    and coprime factorization based techniques. All implemented routines can be 
    employed to reduce both stable and unstable, continuous- or discrete-time 
    models or controllers. The underlying numerical algorithms are based on extensions 
    of the square-root and balancing-free accuracy enhancing technique developed 
    by the author for balancing-related model reduction. The new model and controller 
    reduction routines for SLICOT are among the most powerful and numerically 
    most reliable software tools available for model and controller reduction. 
    To facilitate their usage, easy-to-use and flexible interfaces have been developed 
    to integrate them in MATLAB and Scilab.

    <em>Robust control of a disk drive servo system</em><br>
    SLICOT Working Note 2001-7: December 2001.</a> 
  <dd><br>
  <dd>In this expository paper we show the application of some of the SLICOT routines 
    in the robust control analysis and design of a disk drive servo system. An 
    uncertainty model of the system plant is first derived which contains eleven 
    uncertain parameters including four resonance frequencies, four damping coefficients 
    and three rigid body model parameters. Three controllers for the uncertain 
    system are designed using, respectively, the techniques of H_inf mixed sensitivity 
    design, H_inf loop shaping design procedure (LSDP) and mu-synthesis method. 
    With these controllers the closed-loop system achieves robust stability and 
    in the cases of H_inf and mu-controllers the closed loop system practically 
    achieves robust performance. A detailed comparison of the frequency domain 
    and time domain characteristics of the closed-loop system with the three controllers 
    is conducted. Further, model reduction routines have been applied to find 
    a reasonably low order controller based on the mu-synthesis design. This reduced 
    order controller maintains the robust stability and robust performance of 
    the closed-loop system. Simulations of the nonlinear sampled-data servo system 
    with the low order controller have been included as well, which confirms the 
    practical applicability of the controller obtained.

    <em>Recursive Blocked Algorithms for Solving Triangular Matrix Equations---Part 
    II: Two-sided and Generalized Sylvester and Lyapunov Equations</em><br>
    SLICOT Working Note 2001-5: September 2001.</a> 
  <dd><br>
  <dd>We continue our study on high-performance algorithms for solving triangular 
    matrix equations. They appear naturally in different condition estimation 
    problems for matrix equations and various eigenspace computations, and as 
    reduced systems in standard algorithms. Building on our successful recursive 
    approach applied to one-sided matrix equations (Part I), we now present recursive 
    blocked algorithms for two-sided matrix equations, which include matrix product 
    terms such as AXB T . Examples are the discrete-time standard and generalized 
    Sylvester and Lyapunov equations. The means for high-performance are the recursive 
    variable blocking, which has the potential of matching the memory hierarchies 
    of today's high-performance computing systems, and level 3 computations which 
    mainly are performed as GEMM operations. Different implementation issues are 
    discussed, focusing on similarities and differences between one-sided and 
    two-sided matrix equations. We present uniprocessor and SMP parallel performance 
    results of recursive blocked algorithms and routines in the state-of-the-art 
    SLICOT library. The performance improvements of our recursive algorithms are 
    remarkable, including 10-folded speedups or more, compared to standard algorithms.

    SLICOT Working Note 2001-4: available since April 2001 and revised in August 
    2001.</a> 
  <dd><br>
  <dd>Triangular matrix equations appear naturally in estimating the condition 
    numbers of matrix equations and different eigenspace computations, including 
    block-diagonalization of matrices and matrix pairs and computation of functions 
    of matrices. To solve a triangular matrix equation is also a major step in 
    the classical Bartels-Stewart method. We present recursive blocked algorithms 
    for solving one-sided triangular matrix equations, including the continuous-time 
    Sylvester and Lyapunov equations, and a generalized coupled Sylvester equation. 
    The main parts of the computations are performed as level 3 general matrix 
    multiply and add (GEMM) operations. Recursion leads to an automatic variable 
    blocking that has the potential of matching the memory hierarchies of today's 
    HPC systems. Different implementation issues are discussed, including when 
    to end the recursion, the design of optimized superscalar kernels for solving 
    leaf-node triangular matrix equations efficiently, and how parallelism is 
    utilized in our implementations. Uniprocessor and SMP parallel performance 
    results of our recursive blocked algorithms and corresponding routines in 
    the state-of-the-art libraries LAPACK and SLICOT are presented. The performance 
    improvements of our recursive algorithms are remarkable, including 10-folded 
    speedups compared to standard algorithms.

    <em>Robust Control of a Triple Inverted Pendulum Using mu-Synthesis.</em><br>
    SLICOT Working Note 2001-1: January 2001.</a> 
  <dd><br>
  <dd>In this paper we apply some of the SLICOT routines in the mu-synthesis of 
    a robust control system for a triple inverted pendulum. We consider the case 
    of a mixed type uncertainty consisting of two complex uncertainties in the 
    actuators, three real uncertainties in the moments of inertia and three real 
    uncertainties in the viscous friction coefficients. Using the D-K iteration, 
    a further fictitious complex uncertainty block is included and a mu-controller 
    is constructed for which the closed-loop control system achieves robust stability 
    and robust performance as requested. The influence of the individual uncertainty 
    on the robust stability is investigated using mu-analysis. In addition a reduced 
    order controller is found such that the robust stability and robust performance 
    of the closed-loop system are preserved with the much lower order controller. 
    In the design, the structured singular value mu is calculated with the SLICOT 
    routine AB13MD and the model reduction toolbox in SLICOT is used in the model 
    reduction of the mu controller. The computation experience shows that the 
    SLICOT routines perform better than the counterpart routines in MATLAB in 
    terms of speed and accuracy.

  <dd><br>
  <dd>In this report an interface system for the execution of several widely-used 
    integrator packages for the solving of Ordinary Differential Equations and 
    Diffferential Algebraic Equations is presented. This package offers a SLICOT-compliant 
    unique interface to the packages ODEPACK (LSODE, LSODA, LSODES, LSODI, LSOIBT), 
    DASSL, RADAU5, DASPK and GELDA. All the parameters have been standarised to 
    allow a quick change from one package to another and to take profit of the 
    different capabilities of the different packages. The interface has also been 
    migrated to MATLAB offering the possibility of defining the system functions 
    as MATLAB m-files, using the FORTRAN compiled solver packages instead of the 
    MATLAB funcions. The source code of the system can be downloaded from the 
    SLICOT repository.

  <dd><br>
  <dd>In this note a survey is given of areas of systems and control where structured 
    matrix problems are important. In identification we mention four different 
    types of data collection : impulse response, input-output pairs, frequency 
    response and covariance data. In each of those, the identification problem 
    can be rewritten in terms of structured matrix problems for which there exist 
    fast decompositions. The use of structured matrix decompositions should yield 
    an improvement in speed of computations. In analysis and design one encounters 
    eigenvalue problems with specific structure such as cyclic, Hamiltonian and 
    symplectic matrices. For those problems it is important to use structure preserving 
    decompositions, mainly to improve the numerical accuracy of the computations, 
    although these algorithms typically yield improved computational complexities 
    as well. We also list the key numerical routines that should be provided in 
    the SLICOT library in order to tackle most of the problems mentioned in this

    NICONET Report 1999-8: June 1999.</a> 
  <dd><br>
  <dd>We report on the newest developments of model reduction software for SLICOT. 
    Three enhanced accuracy model reduction algorithms belonging to the class 
    of methods based on or related to balancing techniques form the basis of model 
    reduction software in SLICOT. These methods are primarily intended for the 
    reduction of linear, stable, continuous- or discrete-time systems. However, 
    in combination with additive spectral decomposition or coprime factorization 
    techniques the basic methods can be employed to reduce unstable systems too. 
    The implemented computational methods for reduction of stable and unstable 
    systems, and the associated software available in SLICOT are presented. Performance 
    comparisons performed using appropriate interface software to user-friendly 
    environments like MATLAB and Scilab show the superiority of SLICOT model reduction 
    tools over existing model reduction software.

			NICONET Report 97-3: June 1997 (to appear in Applied and Computational Control, Signals, and Circuits)</a></p>
			<dd>This article describes the subroutine library SLICOT that provides Fortran 77 implementations of numerical algorithms for computations in systems and control theory. Around a nucleus of basic numerical linear algebra subroutines, this library builds methods for the design and analysis of linear control systems. A brief history of the library is given together with a description of the current version of the library and the on-going activities to complete and improve the library in several aspects

			<dd>Basic algorithms and LAPACK-based Fortran software for multivariable system identification by subspace techniques are described. Deterministic and combined deterministic-stochastic identification problems are dealt with using two approaches: MOESP (Multivariable Output Error state SPace) and N4SID (Numerical algorithm for Subspace State Space System IDentification). A state space model is computed from input-output data sequences. Multiple data sequences, collected by possibly independent identification experiments, can be handled. Sequential processing of large data sets can be used as an option. Illustrative numerical examples are included.

			<em>Improving the efficiency and accuracy of the MATLAB control toolbox using SLICOT-based gateways.</em><br>
			Presented at MTNS98 Padova, Italy, July 6-10, 1998, (Proceedings of MTNS98).</a>
			<dd><br>
			<dd>The paper presents performance results for some components of the new, public-domain version of the SLICOT library in comparison with equivalent computations by some MATLAB functions included in the Control Toolbox. SLICOT incorporates the new algorothmic developments in numerical linear algebra, implemented in the state-of-the-art software packages LAPACK and BLAS. The results show that at comparable or better accuracy, SLICOT routines are several times faster than MATLAB computations.

			<dd>Robust and performant numerical software for control systems analysis and design, such as the SLICOT and RASP libraries, is an essential ingredient in modern computer aided control systems design. To avoid duplicating the implementation efforts and ensure a wider dissemination, the originators of the SLICOT and RASP libraries have agreed to combine their libraries and make the joint library freely available. To extend the scope of cooperation, a thematic network for numerics in control NICONET is set up. This paper motivates the need for such a network and describes the objectives, benefits and main network activities.

			<em>Developments around the Freeware Standard Control Library SLICOT</em><br>
			Proc. CACSD'96 Symposium, Dearborn, MI, pp. 473-476, 1996.</a></p>
			<dd>Robust and performant numerical software for control systems analysis and design, such as the SLICOT and RASP libraries, is an essential ingredient in modern CACSD design. SLICOT, realised by WGS in cooperation with NAG, can primarily be viewed as a mathematical library for control theoretical computations. To avoid duplicating the implementation efforts of good quality software existing elsewhere, WGS and DLR, originator of the RASP control engineering library, have agreed to integrate these libraries into a joint standard control library. Making the product now freely available will ensure a wider and faster distribution of these computational tools and will make the much needed software more easily accessible to European industry in the short term. detailed plans have been developed for the instigation of a thematic network on numerics in control with the intention of extending the scope of cooperation to a European level.

			Proc. Asian Control Conference, Tokyo, Japan, vol. 3, pp. 81-84, 1994.</a>
			<dd><br>
			<dd>The paper presents the new integrated model-reduction facilities available in the control engineering design environment ANDECS. The suite of interactive model reduction modules is based on a new generation of numerically reliable algorithms to solve model reduction and associated problems. The model reduction tools complement the already existing system analysis and design tools in ANDECS and strongly benefit of the advanced simulation and visualisation aids, and the multi-objective programming facilities for parametric studies already available there.
