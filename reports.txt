TITLE:          SLICOT - A Subroutine Library in Systems and Control Theory
ABSTRACT:       This article describes the subroutine library SLICOT that
                provides Fortran 77 implementations of numerical algorithms
                for computations in systems and control theory. Around a
                nucleus of basic numerical linear algebra subroutines,
                this library builds methods for the design and analysis of
                linear control systems. A brief history of the library is
                given together with a description of the current version
                of the library and the on-going activities to complete and
                improve the library in several aspects.

ABSTRACT:       This paper contains guidelines for setting up benchmark
                collections for SLICOT. The purpose of these SLICOT
                benchmark collections is to establish an environment for
                testing the subroutines within the SLICOT library and
                compare their performance with other numerical software.
                Guidelines for the submission of benchmark examples by
                external contributors are given, as well as guidelines
                for the implementation of benchmark routines within SLICOT.

TITLE:          Fortran 77 routines for H_{infinity} and H_2 design of
                continuous-time linear control systems
ABSTRACT:       Fortran 77 routines are presented for state-space design of
                H_{inifinity} (sub)optimal controllers and H_2 optimal
                controllers for linear continuous-time control systems.
                The subroutines make use of LAPACK and BLAS libraries and
                produce estimates of the conditioning of the corresponding
                matrix algebraic Riccati equations. Modifed formulae are
                implemented in the case of H_{infinity} design which allows
                to reduce the order of the inverted matrices. The subroutines
                will be included in the SLICOT library.

TITLE:          Improving the efficiency and accuracy of the MATLAB control
                toolbox using SLICOT-based gateways
ABSTRACT:       The paper presents performance results for some components
                of the new, public-domain version of the SLICOT library
                in comparison with equivalent computations performed by
                some MATLAB functions included in the Control Toolbox.
                SLICOT incorporates the new algorithmic developments in
                numerical linear algebra, implemented in the state-of-the-art
                software packages LAPACK and BLAS. The results show that,
               at comparable or better accuracy, SLICOT routines are several
               times faster than MATLAB computations.

TITLE:          A portable subroutine library for solving linear control
                problems on distributed memory computers
ABSTRACT:       This paper describes the design of a software library for
                solving the basic computational problems that arise in
                analysis and synthesis of linear control systems. The
                library is intended for use in high performance computing
                environments based on parallel distributed memory
                architectures. The portability of the library is ensured
                by using the BLACS, PBLAS, and ScaLAPACK as the basic layer
                of communication and computational routines. Preliminary
                numerical results demonstrate the performance of the
                developed codes on parallel computers. The suggested
                library can serve as a basic layer for PSLICOT, a parallel
                extension of the Subroutine Library in Control Theory (SLICOT).

TITLE:          SLICOT drives tractors!
ABSTRACT:       We describe the successful application of a SLICOT subroutine
                in a control engineering problem. Based on GPS data it is
                possible to automatically steer farm vehicles along a
                prescribed trajectory. The bottleneck for the successful
                on-line implementation of a LQG regulator is the numerical
                solution of a discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation in
                real-time and at high accuracy. This is achieved employing a
                Fortran-77 subroutine from the Subroutine Library in
                Control Theory SLICOT.

TITLE:          Efficient implementation of subspace method identification
                algorithms
ABSTRACT:       This paper summarises the results of a study to improve
                existing Subspace Method Identification (SMI) algorithms.
                Significant improvements in calculation speed can be
                achieved by combining components from existing algorithms
                namely N4SID and MOESP. A second improvement can be achieved
                by more efficient implementation of critical parts of the
                algorithms.

ABSTRACT:       This Niconet report is prepared for users of the software
                package SLICOT who are not familiar with the H-infinity
                optimisation design approach. Together with some previous
                Niconet reports it is hoped that the reader would have a
                general idea about the H-infinity method, know how to use
                the algorithms available in SLICOT to synthesize a
                controller for a standard H-infinity optimisation problem
                and, furthermore, be aware of some difficulties such as
                singularity in the H-infinity controllers design.

ABSTRACT:       We present Fortran 77 subroutines intended for state-space
                design of H-infinity (sub)optimal controllers and H2 optimal
                controllers for linear discrete-time control systems.
                The subroutines make use of LAPACK and BLAS libraries and
                produce estimates of the condition numbers of the matrices
                which are to be inverted and estimates of the condition
                numbers of the matrix algebraic Riccati equations which
                are to be solved in the computation of the controllers.
                The subroutines will be included in the SLICOT library.

TITLE:          Model Reduction Routines for SLICOT
ABSTRACT:       We report on the newest developments of model reduction
                software for SLICOT.  Three enhanced accuracy model
                reduction algorithms belonging to the class of methods
                based on or related to balancing techniques form the basis
                of model reduction software in SLICOT. These methods are
                primarily intended for the reduction of linear, stable,
                continuous- or discrete-time systems. However, in combination
                with additive spectral decomposition or coprime
                factorization techniques the basic methods can be employed
                to reduce unstable systems too. The implemented computational
                methods for reduction of stable and unstable systems, and
                the associated software available in SLICOT are presented.
                Performance comparisons performed using appropriate interface
                software to user-friendly environments like MATLAB and
                Scilab show the superiority of SLICOT model reduction tools
                over existing model reduction software.

TITLE:          Selection of basic software tools for structured matrix
                decompositions and perturbations
ABSTRACT:       In this note a survey is given of areas of systems and control
                where structured matrix problems are important. In
                identification we mention four different types of data
                collection : impulse response, input-output pairs,
                frequency response and covariance data. In each of those,
                the identification problem can be rewritten in terms of
                structured matrix problems for which there exist fast
                decompositions. The use of structured matrix decompositions
                should yield an improvement in speed of computations. In
                analysis and design one encounters eigenvalue problems with
                specific structure such as cyclic, Hamiltonian and symplectic
                matrices.  For those problems it is important to use structure
                preserving decompositions, mainly to improve the numerical
                accuracy of the computations, although these algorithms
                typically yield improved computational complexities as well.
                We also list the key numerical routines that should be
                provided in the SLICOT library in order to tackle most of the
                problems mentioned in this note.

TITLE:          Numerical solution of matrix Riccati equations: a comparison
                of six solvers
ABSTRACT:       We present results from the evaluation of six solvers intended
                for the numerical solution of continuous-time matrix algebraic
                Riccati equations. The solvers include the MATLAB functions
                from different toolboxes and two Fortran 77 solvers developed
                by the authors. The comparison implements two benchmark
                problems each comprising 1600 6-th order Riccati equations
                with known solutions. For each solver and each equation we
                compute the relative forward and backward errors and for two
                of the solvers we investigate the accuracy of condition and
                error estimates. Some conclusions concerning the numerical
                behaviour of the solvers are given.

TITLE:          A MATLAB MEX-file environment of SLICOT
ABSTRACT:       Several MEX-files are developed based on SLICOT Fortran
                subroutines. The MEX-files provide new tools for the
                numerical solution of some classical control problems,
                such as the solution of linear or Riccati matrix equations
                computations in the MATLAB environment. Numerical tests show
                that the resulting MEX-files are equally accurate and much
                more efficient than the corresponding MATLAB  functions in
                the control system toolbox and the robust control toolbox.
                In order to increase user-friendlyness the related m-files
                are also developed so that the MEX-file interface to the
                corresponding SLICOT routines can be implemented directly
                and easily.

TITLE:          H_inf and H_2 optimization toolbox in SLICOT
ABSTRACT:       This report summarizes the progress made in the sub-task
                IV.A of the NICONET project. Selected routines to implement
                H_inf and H_2 (sub) optimization syntheses are listed, which
                have all been standardized and included in the SLICOT
                package. The integration of those routines in MATLAB has also
                been completed; the mex files are attached in the appendices.
                This report discusses the  selection and testing of benchmark
                problems with regard to the developed routines, and the
                comparisons made between these routines and others available in
                MATLAB. In particular, two industrial benchmark case studies,
                namely the controller design of a Bell 205 helicopter and a
                distillation column design, are introduced and the design
                results, obtained using the developed routines, are analysed.

ABSTRACT:       A collection of benchmark examples is presented for the
                numerical solution of continuous-time algebraic Riccati
                equations. This collection may serve for testing purposes
                in the construction of new numerical methods, but may also
                be used as a reference set for the comparison of methods.
                The collected examples focus mainly on applications in
                linear-quadratic optimal control theory. This version
                updates an earlier benchmark collection and includes one new
                example.

TITLE:          DAREX --- A Collection of Benchmark Examples for Discrete-Time
                Algebraic Riccati Equations (Version 2.0)
ABSTRACT:       This is the second part of a collection of benchmark
                examples for the numerical solution of algebraic Riccati
                equations. After presenting examples for the continuous-time
                case in Part I (CAREX), our concern in this paper is
                discrete-time algebraic Riccati equations. This collection
                may serve for testing purposes in the construction of new
                numerical methods, but may also be used as a reference set
                for the comparison of methods. This version updates an
                earlier benchmark collection.  Some of the examples have
                been extended by incorporating parameters and there have
                been some new additions to the collection.

                the toolboxes that give interactive access via Matlab or
                Scilab to those routines and describe the benchmark
                problems for this Task. We finally give a few numerical
                examples exhibiting the accuracy and speed of the new
                tools and describe a demo for the routines of this Task.

TITLE:          Task II.B.1 - Selection of Software for Controller Reduction
ABSTRACT:       This working note presents a short overview of methods
                suitable for controller reduction. A first class of methods
                considered are general purpose methods for reduction of
                unstable systems, as for example, absolute and relative
                error methods or frequency weighted methods, both in
                combination with modal separation or coprime factorization
                techniques. Special frequency weighted controller reduction
                methods able to preserve closed-loop stability and even
                closed-loop performance are also discussed. A selection of
                user callable and supporting routines to be implemented
                for controller reduction is proposed.
                The new routines will be included in the SLICOT library.

TITLE:          Benchmarks for Identification
ABSTRACT:       This report describes the preliminary steps for setting up a
                benchmark collection for identification. The identification
                protocol is described, where aspects as experiment set-up,
                signal pre-processing, modelling, parametrization, estimation
                methods and model validation are reviewed briefly. The
                relation of identification and control is stipulated. An
                analysis is given of requirements for good benchmarks for
                identification and some relevant organisational issues are
                addressed.

TITLE:          Symbolic and computational pre-processing in physical
                parameter estimation of multi-body mechanical systems
ABSTRACT:       The objective of this note is to highlight the scope and
                computational (symbolic and/or arithmetic) tasks of turning
                a physical parameter estimation problem into a (constraint)
                optimization problem. Concrete examples show the need for
                symbolic (object-oriented) modeling environments for
                defining the structure of the physical system to be used
                in the parameter optimization step. Without this (interactive)
                software environment for compiling a physical parameter
                estimation problem into an optimization problem,
                standardization of commercial optimization routines is of
                little or no interest.

                Ordinary Differential Equations and Diffferential Algebraic

                unique interface to the packages ODEPACK (LSODE, LSODA,
                LSODES, LSODI, LSOIBT), DASSL, RADAU5, DASPK and GELDA. All
                the parameters have been standardised to allow a quick change
                from one package to another and to take profit of the
                different capabilities of the different packages.
                The interface has also been migrated to MATLAB offering the
                possibility of defining the system functions as MATLAB
                m-files, using the FORTRAN compiled solver packages instead
                of the MATLAB funcions. The source code of the system can be

TITLE:          Nonlinear control systems simulation toolbox in SLICOT
ABSTRACT:       This report presents the SLICOT implementation of the

                to several ODE and DAE libraries is prepared. This interface
                is the entry point to the SLICOT solvers and enables users
                to test the advantages of different approaches. In addition,
                an implementation of a Matlab gateway to the nonlinear
                control sysstems simulation interface is developed which
                enables the user to define the problems using matlab code,
                including the definition of the system functions and
                Jacobians. Also, the performance of the toolbox using

ABSTRACT:       This report briefly introduces the H_inf loop shaping design
                procedure (LSDP) in the discrete-time case as well as its
                implementation in the software package SLICOT. Solution
                formulae are presented with the exposure of a relationship
                between the solutions to the three discrete-time, algebraic
                Riccati equations (DARE) required in the construction of an
                LSDP controller. These SLICOT routines also produce estimates
                of the condition numbers of the DARE solutions, which reveals
                the accuracy and reliability of the computational results.
                The developed routines are tested in a design example,

TITLE:          Robust Control of a Triple Inverted Pendulum using mu-Synthesis
ABSTRACT:       In this paper we apply some of the SLICOT routines in the
                mu-synthesis of a robust control system for a triple inverted
                pendulum. We consider the case of a mixed type uncertainty
                consisting of two complex uncertainties in the actuators,
                three real uncertainties in the moments of inertia and three
                real uncertainties in the viscous friction coefficients.
                Using the D-K iteration, a further fictitous complex
                uncertainty block is included and a mu-controller is
                constructed for which the closed-loop control
                system achieves robust stability and robust performance as
                requested. The influence of the individual uncertainty on the
                robust stability is investigated using mu-analysis. In
                addition a reduced order controller is found such that the
                robust stability and robust performance of the closed-loop
                system are preserved with the much lower order controller.
                In the design, the structured singular value mu is calculated
                with the SLICOT routine AB13MD and the model reduction
                toolbox in SLICOT is used in the model reduction of the
                mu controller. The computation experience shows that the
                SLICOT routines perform better than the counterpart routines in
                MATLAB in terms of speed and accuracy.

TITLE:          Recursive Blocked Algorithms for Solving Triangular
                Matrix Equations---Part I: One-Sided and Coupled
                Sylvester-Type Equations
ABSTRACT:       Triangular matrix equations appear naturally in estimating
                the condition numbers of matrix equations and different
                eigenspace computations, including block-diagonalization of
                matrices and matrix pairs and computation of functions of
                matrices. To solve a triangular matrix equation is also a
                major step in the classical Bartels-Stewart method. We present
                recursive blocked algorithms for solving one-sided triangular
                matrix equations, including the continuous-time Sylvester and
                Lyapunov equations, and a generalized coupled Sylvester
                equation. The main parts of the computations are performed as
                level 3 general matrix multiply and add (GEMM) operations.
                Recursion leads to an automatic variable blocking that has the
                potential of matching the memory hierarchies of today's HPC
                systems. Different implementation issues are discussed,
                including when to end the recursion, the design of optimized
                superscalar kernels for solving leaf-node triangular matrix
                equations efficiently, and how parallelism is utilized in our
                implementations. Uniprocessor and SMP parallel performance
                results of our recursive blocked algorithms and corresponding
                routines in the state-of-the-art libraries LAPACK and SLICOT
                are presented. The performance improvements of our recursive
                algorithms are remarkable, including 10-folded speedups
                compared to standard algorithms.

TITLE:          Recursive Blocked Algorithms for Solving Triangular
                Matrix Equations---Part II: Two-sided and Generalized
                Sylvester and Lyapunov Equations
ABSTRACT:       We continue our study on high-performance algorithms for
                solving triangular matrix equations. They appear naturally
                in different condition estimation problems for matrix
                equations and various eigenspace computations, and as
                reduced systems in standard algorithms. Building on our
                successful recursive approach applied to one-sided matrix
                equations (Part I), we now present recursive blocked
                algorithms for two-sided matrix equations, which include
                matrix product terms such as AXB T . Examples are the
                discrete-time standard and generalized Sylvester and
                Lyapunov equations. The means for high-performance are the
                recursive variable blocking, which has the potential of
                matching the memory hierarchies of today's high-performance
                computing systems, and level 3 computations which mainly are
                performed as GEMM operations. Different implementation issues
                are discussed, focusing on similarities and differences
                between one-sided and two-sided matrix equations. We present
                uniprocessor and SMP parallel performance results of recursive
                blocked algorithms and routines in the state-of-the-art SLICOT
                library. The performance improvements of our recursive
                algorithms are remarkable, including 10-folded speedups or
                more, compared to standard algorithms.

TITLE:          Robust control of a disk drive servo system
ABSTRACT:       In this expository paper we show the application of some 
                of the SLICOT routines in the robust control analysis 
                and design of a disk drive servo system. An uncertainty 
                model of the system plant is first derived which contains
                eleven uncertain parameters including four resonance
                frequencies, four damping coefficients and three rigid
                body model parameters. Three controllers for the uncertain
                system are designed using, respectively, the techniques
                of H_inf mixed sensitivity design, H_inf loop shaping
                design procedure (LSDP) and mu-synthesis method. With
                these controllers the closed-loop system achieves
                robust stability and in the cases of H_inf and
                mu-controllers the closed loop system practically
                achieves robust performance. A detailed comparison
                of the frequency domain and time domain characteristics
                of the closed-loop system with the three controllers
                is conducted. Further, model reduction routines
                have been applied to find a reasonably low order
                controller based on the mu-synthesis design.
                This reduced order controller maintains the robust
                stability and robust performance of the closed-loop
                system. Simulations of the nonlinear sampled-data
                servo system with the low order controller have
                been included as well, which confirms the practical
                applicability of the controller obtained.

AUTHOR:         Andras Varga
TITLE:          New Numerical Software for Model and Controller Reduction
ABSTRACT:       We describe the recently developed model and controller
                reduction software for SLICOT within Task II.B of the
                NICONET Project. A powerful collection of user callable
                Fortran 77 routines has been implemented based on the
                latest algorithmic developments which cover the relative
                error model reduction using the balanced stochastic
                truncation approach, model reduction using frequency-weighted
                balancing and frequency-weighted Hankel-norm approximation
                methods, as well as special controller reduction methods
                using the frequency-weighted balancing and coprime
                factorization based techniques. All implemented routines
                can be employed to reduce both stable and unstable,
                continuous- or discrete-time models or controllers.
                The underlying numerical algorithms are based on extensions
                of the square-root and balancing-free accuracy enhancing
                technique developed by the author for balancing-related
                model reduction. The new model and controller reduction
                routines for SLICOT are among the most powerful and
                numerically most reliable software tools available for
                model and controller reduction. To facilitate their usage,
                easy-to-use and flexible interfaces have been developed
                to integrate them in MATLAB and Scilab.

ABSTRACT:       SLICOT is a comprehensive numerical software package for control 
                systems analysis and design.  While based on highly performant 
                Fortran routines, MATLAB and Scilab interfaces provide convenient

                contained in the three SLICOT toolboxes for (i) basic tasks in 
                systems and control, (ii) system identification, and (iii)

TITLE:          How a numerical rank revealing instability affects Computer
                Aided Control System Design
ABSTRACT:       Since numerical libraries are used in engineering design in a 
                variety of industrial applications, it is important that their 
                numerical reliability is the top priority of both the developers 
                of numerical algorithms and users from industry. Following that 
                principle, we have examined a state of the art control library
                (case study: SLICOT) with respect to use of rank revealing 
                subroutines in computing various canonical decompositions of 
                linear time invariant systems. This issue seems to be critical, 
                with potential for causing numerical catastrophes, because the 
                deployed rank revealing code is prone to severe instabilities, 
                causing completely wrongly computed parameters of systems 
                under analysis. We analyze the SLICOT library in detail and 
                propose modifications of critical parts of the code, based on 
                our recent work published in the ACM Trans. Math. Softw. 35, 
                2008, where we analyze and solve the problem. The proposed
                modifications increase numerical reliability of all of the 
                sixty affected subroutines. We recommend that the developers 
                of other control theory numerical libraries examine their 
                codes with respect to the issue discussed in this paper.

                difficulty. The results show that the new algorithm 
                is signicantly faster, more robust, and more accurate, 
                especially for hard examples.

TITLE:          On BLAS Level-3 Implementations of Common Solvers for
                (Quasi-) Triangular Generalized Lyapunov Equations
ABSTRACT:       The solutions of Lyapunov and generalized Lyapunov 
                equations are a key player in many applications in 
                systems and control theory. Their stable numerical 
                computation, when the full solution is sought, is 
                considered solved since the seminal work of Bartels 
                and Stewart. A number of variants of their algorithm
                have been proposed, but none of them goes beyond
                BLAS level-2 style implementation. On modern 
                computers, however, the formulation of BLAS level-3 
                type implementations is crucial to enable optimal 
                usage of cache hierarchies and modern block scheduling 
                methods based on directed acyclic graphs describing 
                the interdependence of single block computations. 
                Our contribution closes this gap by a transformation 
                of the aforementioned level-2 variants to level-3 
                versions and a comparison on a standard multicore 
                machine.
